# Dnd 5e Spell Book

A personal project built with React to study filtering, pagination, styled-components, among other things.

Also a fun project that I think might be useful for other people, and that's also a plus! ðŸŽ‰

I will be using the [Open 5e API](https://open5e.com/api-docs), and further credits will be given at the end.
